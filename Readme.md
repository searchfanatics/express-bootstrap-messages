# Express Messages for Twitter Bootstrap
      
The _express-bootstrap-messages_ module provides flash notification rendering. To use simply assign it to a dynamic helper:

    app.dynamicHelpers({ messages: require('express-messages') });

## Installation

    $ npm install express-bootstrap-messages

## Usage

On the server, add messages like this:

    req.flash("Error", {"header": "Oh Snap!", "text": "You accidentally the whole thing!"});

Then in a view you may output the notifications based on your templating engine:

### [Razor](https://github.com/davidmurdoch/razorjs)

    @Html.Raw(messages())

### [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs)

    <%- messages() %>

### [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)

    != messages()

Which outputs HTML as shown below:

    <div class="alerts">
      <div class="alert alert-error">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">Ã—</button>
        <h4 class="alert-heading">Oh Snap!</h4>
        You accidentally the whole thing!
      </div>
    </div>

## Running Tests

First make sure you have the submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Then run the tests:

    $ make test
